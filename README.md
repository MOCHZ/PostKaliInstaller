# Post Kali Installer
This script was built for simple post installation of any tool needed after the initial installation of the regular 64 bit version of Kali Linux.

For configuring this script according to your own needs please review the packages in the _apt_packages(), _git_packages(), and __wget_packages() methods and change them according to your preferred configuration. If you are new to Kali Linux then you should be ok running the vanilla configuration.
